Streaming System Base Image
-----

Contained should be everything you need for a base streaming-system container, if you don't wish to pull from the Docker.io repository. To build, do the following:

1. git clone or otherwise obtain this directory
2. docker build .
3. Use this image however you wish :)

Currently, get-pip.py is in sources and is required to build this image. This might change in the future.

TODO:
- Nothing, currently.
